Artificial Neural Network of the Haberman Survival Data

#######################################################
ABSTRACT: 

The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

#######################################################
PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

Being a binary classification problem (survived for 5 years or more following breast cancer surgery=1, or perishing within 5 years=0). Can we define, compile, fit, and evualuate our model then use it make predictions on new data?

#######################################################
DATA SET INFORMATION:

The data associated with this analysis (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman%27s+Survival) contains the following information:
 1. Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)
2. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)
3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
4. Survival status (class attribute): 
-- 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer
-- 2 = the patient died within 5 years (I modified the dataset, changing the 2 to a 0)
